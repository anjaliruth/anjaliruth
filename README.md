### Hi there, my name is Anjali 👋


## About me 

I am a recent Chemical Engineering Graduate from University College London and am currently learning full-stack web development at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). I am actively seeking employment as a Front-End/Back-End/Full-Stack Developer after completing the bootcamp on 30th June.

I transitioned into tech to merge my transferrable skills honed as an Engineer (teamwork, problem-solving, analyticak thinking and technical aptitude) with my love of continuous learning(having learned 15 skills since 2020). 

👥 Currently engaged in a collaborative 5-week full-stack project at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) with a team of 6.

🏗️ As a side project, I am currently working on a full-stack Time Tracking web app project that displays the amount of productive hours a user has put in for the day with stretch goals of displaying Daily, Weeky and Monthly productivity data. 

📚 I am currently learning about Responsive Layouts with this course: [Conquering Responsive Layout](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts)
