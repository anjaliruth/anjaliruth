### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About me 

I am a recent Chemical Engineering Graduate from University College London and am currently learning full-stack web development at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/)

I transitioned into tech to merge my transferrable skills honed as an Engineer (teamwork, problem-solving, analyticak thinking and technical aptitude) with my love of continuous learning(having learned 15 skills since 2020).
